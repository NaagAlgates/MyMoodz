## 🧠 Human + AI Collaboration

MyMoodz was built by an independent developer in Australia, supported by ethical use of Generative AI. All core decisions — especially around privacy, user experience, and app design — were made by a human with care and intentionality.

We believe that transparency around AI use is part of building honest, trustworthy software.
