# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: April 23, 2025**

Your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how the **MyMoodz iOS app** handles your data, what information is collected (if any), and how we ensure that your information remains private and secure.

## 📱 About MyMoodz

**MyMoodz** is a mood-tracking app designed to help you reflect on your emotions, identify patterns, and promote emotional wellbeing. It is built with a strict **privacy-first approach**, and all data is handled with care and transparency.

---

## 🧾 What Data We Collect

MyMoodz **does not collect or store any personal identifying information**.

All mood entries, notes, timestamps, and settings are:

- **Stored locally** on your device  
- Never sent to external servers  
- Not associated with your identity, email, Apple ID, or any account  

We do **not** collect:

- Names  
- Email addresses  
- Location data  
- Contacts  
- Device identifiers  
- Usage analytics  

---

## 🛠️ How Your Data is Used

Your mood data is used solely for the purpose of enabling app features:

- Displaying mood history in the **Timeline**  
- Generating visual insights in the **Insights tab**  
- Supporting features like search, filter, and sort  

All computations and data visualizations are performed **on-device**.

---

## ☁️ No Cloud Sync

MyMoodz does **not use cloud storage** (e.g. iCloud or third-party sync). Your data stays entirely on your device unless:

- You manually export it (feature in development)  
- You back up your phone through iOS backups (Apple-controlled)  

---

## 🔒 Device-Level Security

All your mood logs are saved on your phone's local storage, and protected by the **security of your device** (Face ID, passcode, etc.). MyMoodz relies on Apple’s native storage systems to ensure integrity.

---

## 🎯 No Advertising. No Tracking

MyMoodz is:

- 100% ad-free  
- Free of tracking pixels, cookies, or analytics SDKs  
- Not integrated with Google Analytics, Firebase, or Facebook SDK  

---

## 👥 Third-Party Services

We do not share your data with any third parties. No user data is sent off-device — not for analytics, not for advertising, not for performance tracking.

We may include **open-source libraries** in the app, but none of them collect or transmit user data.

---

## ✉️ Feedback & Contact

If you contact us via email (e.g. to provide feedback), your message may be stored in our inbox, but is never shared or used for marketing purposes.

**Contact:** <me@nagaraj.com.au>

You may:

- Delete the app at any time to remove all stored data  
- Use your phone’s data management settings to clear or manage app storage
